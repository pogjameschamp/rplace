Welcome to my Pixel Canvas Project (a clone of r/place). This project provides a dynamic and interactive pixel canvas where users can draw by placing colored pixels onto a grid. Utilizing the power of JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API, users can hover over cells to preview placements and click to finalize their drawings. The project harnesses real-time communication facilitated by socket.io, ensuring synchronized canvas states among multiple users. On the frontend, the design is handled by jQuery, delivering an intuitive user experience with color selection buttons and direct pixel manipulation. Meanwhile, the backend relies on Node.js, seamlessly managing data and user interactions, with MongoDB Atlas serving as the foundational database to persistently store the canvas state.
